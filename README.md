# Reflection Questions
    - What was the biggest challenge of scraping the web site?
The biggest challenge was figuring out where I needed to adjust the class names that had spaces as well as stacking find_element functions for elements that were in a different generation than the other items in my for loop
    - What insight, if any, did you gain from the analysis and visualization of the laptop data?
Insights from this data are that there is not a clear correlation between laptop price and the number of reviews the laptop receives. There also didn't seem to be a particular brand that was reviewed more often than others. Both the brands and price points had items with few reviews and more reviews. It could be useful to find sales data to figure out the sales to number of reviews ratio.
